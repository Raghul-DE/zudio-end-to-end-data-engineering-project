# zudio-end-to-end-data-engineering-project
This project builds an ETL pipeline using the Zudio sales dataset on AWS. It extracts raw sales data from S3, transforms it into structured datasets (Sales Data, Store Info, Inventory Data), and loads the transformed files back into S3. Processed files are archived to prevent reprocessing.
